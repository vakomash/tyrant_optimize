//Bugs/Fix
Tributed On-Attacked-Rally during enemy turn on a cooldown card -> (Impact by now == 0, but it is wrong)
Flying units don't get mark stacks in tuo, but should get them -> no impact
Enhance Bravery/Absorb on comamnders?

brawl-defense:
improve brawl formula for guild brawl (exclude fortresses?)?

//Testing


?getting Subdued w/o dealt damage?
Add more single unit test cases
Add more whole deck unit test cases

Test single skills with mocking-framework or similar

//Check
Check overall order of card-reduction with summon + on-play skills killing enemies + following enemy index update
On-Play 0-delay Summon timings

mimic no on-play skills
Summon-0-delay card  => new card with summon /valor
bg_effects fd->tapi vs card->tapi
on-death-attacked-summoned cards valid strike/enf.. targets
enfeeble active how long and on whoms turn

//Impl
Avoid reloading xmls (e.g. all_cards) for each unit_test in tyrant_optimize::run(...).

//Var


//Ideas
rule/enemy-based order
state-attacking += state-skills-active
OpenACC, OpenMP, MPI, OpenGL, CUDA support?
Neuronal Network/Maschine Learning playing order (== flex).
Annealex => scale anneal iterations with temperature
Continous Mode to avoid reloading XMLs when used by an external prog.
separate climb/sim from loading/init in tyrant_optimize.cpp
